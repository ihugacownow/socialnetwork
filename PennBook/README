Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
 Entire Assignment.
 
 In addition, I used express-session for the login session, so needed to npm install
 the extra dependency.  
 
 Also edited keyvaluestorage.js and created a function "scanKeyValues" based on scanKeys that 
 returns both key and value pair instead of just the values. 
 
 I also used the required html tag for some of the forms' input fields as a way of error checking as it seemed neater.
